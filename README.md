Simplistic Pokedex implementation using Vue.js and pokeapi.io.

A small side project by Thomas Jirout ([_schiru](https://twitter.com/_schiru)) to experiment with with Vue.js.

TODO:

- update readme
- add picutres to readme
- publish app on render.com

Features:
- Fully responsive design
- Prepared to be localized
- Dependencies contain critial warnings
- First vue project

Possible Improvements:

- Dependency injection
- Split UI into smaller components
